                    <h1>Hi,</h1>
                    <p>I'm front-end developer website, I enjoy taking problems and turning them into simple and
                        beautiful interface designs I love programming and always strive for the newest
                        technologies.</p>

                    <h4>About this site</h4>
                    <p>A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices. This site uses popular materialize.css framework. If you look at my weblogs, more than half of the HTML of each page is boilerplate replicated across all entries. A template allows to express that 50 percent of content only once and have it automatically applied to all the pages.</p>


                    <p>HYDE provides beautiful Syntax Highlighting Plugin to post all my code-snippets in web-logs according to the language's taste. It not only makes code-snippets more readable but also helps in understanding the main points being highlighted.</p>
                        
                        
                    <p>I have used the awesome Materialize Framework for the front-end designing.</p>
                        
                        
                    <p>In case you love to see the engine behind this site, have a look at my Github repo. Contact me by dropping words at andremaesha@gmail.com, if you have any query.</p>
